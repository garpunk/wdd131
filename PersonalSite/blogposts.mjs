      `<p>My interest in memory techniques began in early 2014. At the time I was a senior in 
        highschool who had a bad case of “Senioritis”. I had decided to Homeschool 
        my last year of highschool and did my class work remotely
        for my assignments. My whole life I had struggled with Math, and my
        performance in my senior math class hadn’t been any different. I would
        spend hours blankly and hopelessly staring at the screen during a math
        test, the myriad of math syntax and rules completely forgotten. I
        scraped by, but I wanted something more. I knew that there had to be
        something that could help me remember the rules better. That’s when I
        stumbled upon the technique of memory palaces.</p>
        
        <h3>What is a memory palace?</h3>

      <p>
        Memory Palaces are the idea of using our memory of places and recreating
        them in our minds. From there we insert imagined ideas or concepts that
        we wish to remember and place them in various “positions” in the
        imagined space. For example, let’s say you wanted to remember a grocery
        list without writing it down. Starting from somewhere like your bedroom,
        you could imagine items in your grocery list in each room of your house.
        The more fantastic and memorable the the actions or people surrounding
        the item in your mind, the better you will remember it. Let’s say you
        wanted to remember a grocery list of bananas, apples, and cherries. In
        your bedroom you may imagine King Kong resting on your bed eating from a
        bunch of bananas. Then you move to the next room and imagine something
        like the evil queen from snow white offering an apple to you in the
        living room, and finally maybe George Washington is in the bathroom
        trying to cut a cherry tree down that is growing through the floor. How
        much easier will this descriptive sight be to remember than trying to
        list your groceries in your head? Quite memorable! In fact, professional
        memory athletes use techniques like this to memorize thousands of
        strings of digits in Memory Olympics.

      <h3>Where to begin?</h3>

      <p>
        But before we begin building vast memory palaces filled with thousands
        of items, It’s better for us to start small. Instead of trying to keep
        track of many items or pieces of knowledge inside of a vast imaginative
        palace in our minds, research has found that it’s better to use many
        different smaller palaces based on places we’ve actually visited in real
        life. For beginners, it’s best to use indoor spaces, as our brains can
        sometimes struggle with memorizing the placement of objects outside. We
        create places in our minds called “stations”. These could be as large as
        rooms or as small as the placement of objects in our house. For now,
        let’s focus on only doing a maximum of 10 items in a single palace.
        Start by making a list from a-z of 26 indoor places that you know fairly
        well. The practice of creating many memory palaces will allow your brain
        to exercise its ‘Palace-making’ ability, which will become more and more
        powerful as time goes on. This also gives you the chance to easily
        memorize over 260 individual items without even breaking a sweat! This
        is because all of the items are evenly distributed amongst the many
        palaces your brain has created.
